# 🎲 Pig Game

A two-player dice game where the first player to reach the target score wins. This project was developed to practise JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, and game logic using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## 🚀 Features

- Random dice roll with dynamic dice image
- Two-player turn-based gameplay
- Current and total score tracking
- Interactive buttons
- Win detection and automatic end of game

## 🧠 What I Worked On

### 💻 HTML & CSS

- Semantic HTML structure
- Basic responsive layout
- Styling with utility classes and dynamic class manipulation via JavaScript

### 🧩 JavaScript (Vanilla)

- Full DOM manipulation with `querySelector` and `getElementById`
- Event handling with `addEventListener`
- Conditional logic and ternary operators
- Dynamic class changes with `classList.add/remove/toggle`
- Control flow using functions, `if`/`else`, and loops
- Random number generation using `Math.random()`

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Visual Studio Code
